# Rocketpay

API deployed at https://mendel-rocketpay.herokuapp.com/

I'll soon be adding a simple frontend to test the API

To run locally:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can make rest requests to `localhost:4000/api` from your favorite api tester.
